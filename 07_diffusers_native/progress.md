# Progress: Diffusers Native Optimizations

## Overall Progress: 70%

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Environment setup
- [x] PyTorch 2.5.1 with SDPA verified
- [x] Main Flux Schnell implementation created
- [x] Memory-efficient optimizations implemented
- [x] VAE optimizations implemented
- [x] Requirements file created
- [x] Test script created
- [ ] Dependencies installed and tested
- [ ] Benchmarking completed
- [ ] Results documented

### Current Status:
Created comprehensive Flux Schnell implementation with vanilla diffusers including:
- SDPA (Scaled Dot-Product Attention) - automatic in PyTorch 2.0+
- xFormers memory-efficient attention (optional)
- Model CPU offloading (regular and sequential)
- VAE optimizations (slicing and tiling)
- Attention slicing
- Channels last memory format
- Torch compile support
- Memory usage monitoring
- Benchmarking capabilities

### Features Implemented:
- FluxSchnellOptimized class with comprehensive optimization options
- Memory usage tracking and reporting
- Flexible generation parameters
- Benchmark mode for performance testing
- Command-line interface with optimization flags
- Test scripts for validation

### Next Steps:
- Install required dependencies
- Test basic generation
- Verify memory optimizations work
- Run benchmarks to measure performance
